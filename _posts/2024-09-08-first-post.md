# The Beginning

Firstly I want to start off by saying prior to this I haven't done any sort of coding or website making to aid in making this website. I simply wanted something that is physical proof I can do it. The only previous help is that I work in IT help desk and I have for the last 2 months been trying different linux distros and learning to use CLI. The reason for this site and soon to be more is my attitude and drive to have something that is mine and can become whatever I want it to be just like my new perspective of life and that anything and everything I want in this world can be mine I just have to work hard enough and leave my comfort zone. I by no means am great at english or explain my thoughts well. This is for me and my journey and for anyone else that stumbles upon here to inspire them to just take the leap of faith, jump into the unknown and figure it out. My job is fixing problems that are presented to me and to find the most efficient path to the solution. That is great for a business and productivity but not for curiosity,wonder and ultimately what potential I believe I have and can do. It's easy to stay comfortable and everyone has their own comfortable but you need to keep wonder in your life and find what more you're capable of because there will be a time when you will reach what you once thought was impossible and you will be comfortable with what you achieved.
